# OnlineLibrary
Online Library that gives offline books

## How does this online library works?
You are a great book reader, then you need book to read. Then how can you get it?
Come join our library. :)

You will buy/lend a book from a friend. 
Buying needs money, let's try to reduce possibly here.

Here this library, is for lending books.
All the libraries do the same! What's unique here?

Similar to all libraries, we too provide you books from the physical libraries. This is called Library management.
Then why Library is mentioned?
On your journey to search a book, this library increases the probability of finding the book. How?
On search, you will know if the book is available with the current library?
  if available:
    you can get a book
  if available and not currently:
    it tells you when can you get the book.
  if not at alla available:
     search with the other customers if they have and can lend it to you.
        if yes: they give it to the library and library gives it to you.
        
In this process of making a libreary, we can implement Validations, security, sms tracking and all.

Thus this is my Idea
